{% macro usage_summary_daily( chain, days_forward=365 ) %}


/*
Goal: Provide a table at daily granularity that abstracts away the need to go
through transactions, traces, logs tables in order to generate aggregate stats

Stats:
- # of Transactions Called (Trace - Distinct tx hash)
- # of Event Emitting Transactions (Logs - Distinct tx hash)
- Total Gas Used at Trace-Level (Trace Gas Used) - TBD if we can also integrate the gas spell
- Total Gas Used at Transaction Level (Transaction Gas Used)
- # of Contracts Calling (Trace From)
- # of Tx Senders Calling (Transaction From - When Trace)
- # of Tx Senders Emitting (Transaction From - When Log)


This should only be joined to other contracts tables at the query stage; however, we may read from
the `base` spell unified with `predeploys`, as our identifier for the total set of contracts to evaluate
, or keep this spell agnostic to contracts vs EOAs, and determine this at the query level.
